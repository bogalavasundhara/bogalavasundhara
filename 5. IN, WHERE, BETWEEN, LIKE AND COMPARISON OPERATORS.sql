-- use of LIKE
-- SELECT * from student_data WHERE name LIKE "d%"; this will show no data as none of the name starts from 'd' or 'D'

-- LIKE 'a%', starts with a
-- LIKE '%a', ends with a
-- LIKE '%am%', contains am
-- LIKE '_a%', second letter is a
-- LIKE 'a__', first letter is a and second and third letter is anything
-- LIKE 'a%o', starts with a and ends with o
-- LIKE '_oy', o at second pos and y at third
-- LIKE '_tap%', matches strings which contain substring 'tap' at second position.
-- LIKE 'a__%', matches strings which start with 'r' and contain at least 2 more characters.
-- SELECT * from student_data WHERE name LIKE "%ya%";
-- SELECT * from student_data WHERE name NOT LIKE "a%";
-- to make the query case sensitive we use BINARY
